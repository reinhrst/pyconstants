Constants is a package to work with CONSTANTS, by which I mean unalterable, always true, constants.
This differs from configuartion-parameters that may be different for each project.

Constants are universally true (at least in our universe). These fall apart in two categories:

- True by definition (examples: the number of kilometers in a meter, degrees per radial)
- True by experimental design (example: Avogadro's number, the speed of light in vacuum)

In time (and as requested) all these constants should go into this package; however starting now with a bare minimum.
